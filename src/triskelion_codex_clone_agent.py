"""
TRISKELION Clone Agent Architecture
===================================

This module defines the CloneAgent class, used to generate user-personalized
Codex-based agents with behavioral trait inheritance and a modular prompt pipeline.

Each clone is instantiated with:
- Tone (e.g., poetic, formal)
- Formality level
- Memory depth (session, short-term, long-term)
- Task bias (code, summarization, Q&A, etc.)

The goal is to simulate intelligent Codex interactions that evolve toward
user-aligned behavior using prompt shaping and memory logging.
