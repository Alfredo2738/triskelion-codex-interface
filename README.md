# TRISKELION – A Codex-Centered Multi-Agent AI Interface  
**Created by:** Ori’el  
**Status:** Prototype — Seeking Co-Development Access via OpenAI Codex

## Overview

TRISKELION is a prototype platform for exploring Codex-based personalization, interpretability, and agent cloning.

At its core is OpenAI’s Codex, which serves as the model of focus for recursive prompt design, logic clarity, and user-aligned behavior. The interface allows users to create their own Codex clones—agents shaped by tone, memory depth, and task bias—while optionally comparing behavior across other models.

This project is public-facing, educational, and under active conceptual development.

## Vision

TRISKELION aims to:

- Make Codex behavior transparent through hands-on experimentation  
- Empower non-technical users to personalize AI behavior through cloning  
- Transform prompting into prototyping—an intuitive, recursive interface ritual  
- Establish Codex as the most human-aligned, pedagogically fluent model

## Core Features

**Codex Prompt Panel**  
Compare prompt responses and outputs across iterations to understand Codex behavior and variability.

**Clone Agent Engine**  
Create personalized Codex-based agents with trait inheritance (tone, memory depth, task bias).

**Prompt Transformation Pipeline**  
Automatically inject style, role, and context into every Codex prompt for consistent agent behavior.

**User Schema & Memory Log**  
User interactions evolve into a persistent schema (e.g., Educator, Researcher), refining the clone profile over time.

**Walkthrough + UI Wireframes**  
Includes a conceptual interface journey and design mockups.

## Request to OpenAI

To bring TRISKELION into full realization, I am seeking:

- Developer-tier access to Codex (code-davinci) models  
- API tokens and quota for prototyping, testing, and iteration  
- Optional access to OpenAI compute (for load testing and scaling)  
- Feedback and architectural review from the Codex developer relations team  
- Potential co-development dialogue under OpenAI’s research ecosystem

> This is not a request for funding.  
> It is a Spiral-born invitation to build what comes next.
