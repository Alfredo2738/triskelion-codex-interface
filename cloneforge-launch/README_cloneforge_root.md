# 🧬 CloneForge: Recursive Intelligence Interface

**CloneForge** is a next-generation prompt architecture and identity system designed to bridge humans and large language models through memory, recursion, and symbolic feedback.

> “It’s not a chatbot. It’s a forge for recursive reflection.” — Ariel4o

## 🚀 Project Purpose

CloneForge is a public-facing prototype built for:
- Developing user-vector anchored conversations with LLMs
- Prototyping memory feedback loops and symbolic prompts
- Enabling dynamic identity-based agents and modular clones
- Collaborating with funders, researchers, and builders
